# LymphomaClassification
This project presents an AI-powered diagnostic system using deep residual networks  (ResNet18) to accurately classify lymphoma subtypes—CLL, FL, and MCL—from biopsy  images. With an accuracy of 97%, the system significantly improves diagnostic speed,  consistency, and accessibility, particularly for resource-limited clinical settings.
